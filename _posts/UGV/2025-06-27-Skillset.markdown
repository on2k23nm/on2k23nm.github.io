## 1 ‚ü° Build the Core Knowledge (first 10-12 weeks)

> **Rule of thumb:** every time you finish a concept, you immediately ‚Äúteach it forward‚Äù in a blog post or notebook‚Äîthis locks in the idea *and* fills your public portfolio.

| Week range                                                                                                                                        | What you study & practise                                                                                                  | Key resources (choose at most one per bullet) |

## 2 ‚ü° Publish as You Go ‚Äî 12-post flagship series

Think ‚Äú**From Pixels to Field-Ready UGV**‚Äù:

1. **‚ÄòWhy Vision on a Farm Robot?‚Äô** ‚Äì tie project goals to CV problems (depth, detection, slope sensing).
2. **Math you actually need (and nothing more).**
3. **Building a CNN from first principles in PyTorch autograd.**
4. **Bootstrapping a YOLOv8-n model on a single GPU (transfer learning & data aug).**
5. **Metrics that matter outdoors (mAP *and* latency & watts).**
6. **Demystifying ROS 2 DDS QoS with Wireshark traces.**
7. **ORB-SLAM vs VIO vs RTK: choosing for row-crop navigation.**
8. **Composing `ros2_control` with a simulated swerve drive in Gazebo Hoxy.**
9. **From Python to TensorRT: INT8 calibration on Jetson Orin Nano.**
10. **Costmap fusion: turning detections into real-time obstacle inflation.**
11. **Synthetic-data loops in Isaac Sim for free labelling.**
12. **CI/CD for robots: running Gazebo headless in GitHub Actions.**

*Each article uses the repo you‚Äôre already building; readers can `git pull` and replay results.*

---

## 3 ‚ü° Concrete writing workflow

1. **Single GitHub repo**

   * `/sim_ws` ‚Äì ROS 2 workspace with colcon; branch per episode.
   * `/blog` ‚Äì Markdown (use Jekyll + GitHub Pages) so code & article diff together.
2. **Notebook-then-article**

   * Draft experiments in Jupyter; once outputs look good, export cells/snippets into Markdown.
3. **Video micro-demos**

   * 30-sec GIF or Loom clip of each milestone (e.g., Gazebo robot dodging a moving pallet).
4. **Cross-post lightly**

   * Publish canonical on GitHub Pages; syndicate to Medium/Dev.to with *rel=canonical* tag for SEO.
5. **Newsletter capture**

   * Add ‚Äúfollow along‚Äù form (Buttondown / Substack) so hiring managers can subscribe.

## 4 ‚ü° Parallel project milestones

| Month | Sim / code deliverable                            | Blog tie-in |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **1** | URDF + first tele-op drive in Gazebo              | Posts 1-3   |
| **2** | Nav2 + basic depth camera obstacle layer          | Posts 4-5   |
| **3** | YOLOv8 fused into costmap; TEB local planner      | Posts 6-7   |
| **4** | INT8 model on Orin Nano; real LiDAR-in-sim loop   | Posts 8-10  |
| **5** | First outdoor bag files; closed-loop re-plan demo | Posts 11-12 |

By the time recruiters skim your profile, they‚Äôll see:

* **Code** ‚Äì a living ROS 2 repository with CI badges.
* **Writing** ‚Äì 12 long-form, high-signal posts showing first-principles depth.
* **Media** ‚Äì short demo clips proving it‚Äôs not vapourware.

---

## 5 ‚ü° Signal-boost tips

* **Target keywords** like ‚ÄúROS 2 Jazzy swerve drive‚Äù or ‚ÄúYOLOv8 Jetson INT8‚Äù (they rank fast‚Äîlow competition).
* **Link back** to reputable sources you used (OpenCV blog, Torralba book, Antmicro node article) for credibility.
* **Add a ‚ÄúHire me‚Äù footer**‚Äîrole-aligned bullets, r√©sum√© link, and a note that the hardware build is in progress.
