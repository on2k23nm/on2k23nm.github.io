### Hardware Blueprint – Building Blocks for Your UGV

Below is a **tiered, pick-and-mix catalogue**. Start with the *Essential* column if you’re on a tight budget or want a fast proof-of-concept; move rightward as your compute or environmental demands grow. All items map directly to the project-goal pillars you shared (navigation, perception, power management, safety, modularity).

| Sub-system                    | Essential / PoC                                                                                                                                                                   | Intermediate (AI-ready)                                                                                  | Advanced / Field-ready                                                                          | Why it matters (links to your goals)                                                                                                   |

#### How to choose

1. **Budget vs. compute**
   *If you need YOLOv8 at >30 FPS, go straight to Jetson Orin Nano.* Its recent SW bump pushes it to **67 INT8 TOPS (sparse)** without extra HW ([developer.nvidia.com][2]). The Pi 5 will handle lane detection or basic PID vision but struggles with multi-class detection plus SLAM.

2. **Power envelope**
   Li-ion (higher energy density) is fine for demos; LiFePO₄ is safer, longer-lived, and supports sustained 40 A draw for brushless drives.

3. **Sensor redundancy = reliability**
   Pair LiDAR + depth cam + mmWave radar → graceful degradation in fog/rain/night, fulfilling your “Advanced Obstacle Avoidance”.

4. **MCU separation of concerns**
   The secondary MCU runs in real time (<1 ms loop) for motor control, E-stop, battery alarms. If the SBC crashes, your robot still brakes and radios home.

#### Next actions

1. **Lock in compute + chassis early** so mounting holes, thermal paths and power rails are known.
2. Prototype motor control on bench supply → integrate sensors → iterate in simulation (Gazebo/Isaac Sim).
3. Bring up battery telemetry *before* field tests to validate SoC accuracy vs. coulomb-counting.
4. Add safety relays and dual watchdogs as soon as wheels turn independently.

Feel free to drill into any sub-section (e.g., “Which LiDAR driver for ROS 2 Iron?” or “Exact wiring between BMS and MCU”)—I’ll tailor the finer details to keep everything aligned with your master goals.

**Recommendation: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8 GB (or the slightly faster “Orin Nano Super” dev kit)**

### Why it beats the others for your UGV

1. **Head-room for perception—without external accelerators**

   * Up to **67 INT8 TOPS** in a 7 – 15 W envelope—roughly 14 × a Pi 5 and an order of magnitude above the classic Jetson Nano, yet still below laptop-class power draw. ([nvidia.com][1], [theverge.com][2])
   * Lets you run YOLOv8-m or a full-resolution depth CNN **and** SLAM **simultaneously**, so you won’t outgrow the board when you add row-crop detection or multi-LiDAR fusion later.

2. **ROS 2 and CUDA “just work”**

   * JetPack bundles CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT, GStreamer, and pre-built ROS 2 images—no kernel-patch spelunking or hand-rolled NPU toolchains, unlike many RK3588 boards. ([nvidia.com][1])
   * This aligns with your goal of spending time on autonomy logic, not BSP maintenance.

3. **Manageable power budget for field robots**

   * The 10 W mode gives all of the above performance at only \~3 W more than a Pi 5 + Coral combo, so your existing 4-cell Li-ion pack still yields multi-hour runs. ([nvidia.com][1])

4. **Clean upgrade path & long lifecycle**

   * Module pinout matches the pricier Orin NX and AGX Orin, making it easy to swap-in more TOPS or RAM years down the line without re-laying a carrier board—key for the “generic platform for future agricultural attachments” stated in your goals.

5. **Community and parts availability**

   * Jetson forums, Isaac ROS stacks, and ready-made carrier boards mean faster debugging and a bigger talent pool—handy if you scale the project or hire collaborators.

---

### Why the alternatives fall short

* **Raspberry Pi 5** – superb for low-cost prototyping, but you’d need a Coral or Movidius stick to break 30 FPS detection. That adds cables, draws extra power, and still leaves you CPU-bound for dense segmentation or multi-camera fusion. ([datasheets.raspberrypi.com][3])
* **RK3588 boards (ROCK 5B, Orange Pi 5 Plus)** – the 6-TOPS NPU is efficient, yet kernel patches, limited TensorRT support, and sparse ROS 2 docs mean more integration time—risking project delays when you move beyond basic perception. ([wiki.radxa.com][4])
* **UP Xtreme i12** – x86 muscle and PCIe bandwidth are great for lab-on-robot workloads, but the board can spike past **30 W**; you’d need a heavier battery and active cooling, undercutting your energy-optimization and IP-65 enclosure goals. ([up-board.org][5])

---

### Bottom line

The Jetson Orin Nano 8 GB delivers the **sweet spot** your UGV roadmap needs: enough AI performance to stay future-proof, ROS 2/CUDA turnkey software, and a power draw that still fits within a lightweight battery budget. Pair it with your dedicated safety MCU, and you have a rock-solid compute core that won’t bottleneck perception or autonomy as you scale to real agricultural deployments.
