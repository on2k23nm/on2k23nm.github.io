## Project Goals

To develop a safe, reliable, and electrically-powered Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) with a modular and scalable architecture, capable of executing precise waypoint navigation via advanced localization and real-time mapping; intelligently detecting obstacles to facilitate operator-commanded circumvention and path re-engagement; and providing accurate, real-time predictive battery assessments to ensure mission completion.

## Initial requirements 

These initial foundational capabilities lay a strong groundwork for an Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platform designed for operation in semi-structured or dynamic environments


### Navigation & Path Planning

* **Dynamic Path Re-planning (Advanced Obstacle Avoidance):** Instead of just waiting, the UGV should ideally be able to *autonomously* re-plan its path around dynamic obstacles (e.g., a person walking by, another vehicle) without constant operator intervention, while still adhering to its original goal. This moves beyond simple "wait and indicate."
* **Waypoint Navigation:** The ability to navigate through a series of predefined waypoints, rather than just a single A-B path, allowing for more complex missions.
* **Localization Accuracy:** The UGV needs robust **localization** capabilities (knowing its precise position and orientation in the environment). This could involve **GPS/GNSS**, **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**, **LiDAR odometry**, or **visual odometry**. The accuracy required will depend on the application (e.g., centimeter-level for precision tasks, meter-level for general transport).
* **Mapping:** The UGV should be able to build and maintain a **map** of its environment (e.g., using **SLAM - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping**). This map is crucial for path planning, obstacle detection, and localization.
* **Gradient/Slope Handling:** Ability to detect and safely navigate inclines and declines, with limits on the maximum negotiable slope.
* **Rough Terrain Navigation:** If applicable, the ability to traverse uneven or moderately rough terrain while maintaining stability and traction.

### Obstacle Detection & Avoidance

* **Obstacle Classification:** Differentiating between various types of obstacles (e.g., static, dynamic, human, vehicle, unknown) to inform more intelligent avoidance strategies.
* **Sensor Redundancy & Fusion:** Utilizing multiple sensor types (e.g., **LiDAR, cameras, ultrasonic sensors, radar**) and fusing their data for a more comprehensive and robust environmental perception, especially in challenging conditions (e.g., poor lighting, fog).
* **Collision Prediction & Prevention:** Algorithms that can predict potential collisions with moving obstacles and take evasive action well in advance.
* **Minimum Clearance:** Defining a safe distance the UGV must maintain from obstacles.

### Power & Energy Management

* **Real-time Battery Monitoring:** Continuous and accurate reporting of battery state of charge (SoC) and estimated remaining runtime/distance.
* **Power Consumption Optimization:** Implementing strategies to minimize energy consumption (e.g., optimizing driving speeds, minimizing unnecessary movements).
* **Charging Management:** If applicable, the ability to autonomously return to a charging station when battery levels are low.
* **Battery Degradation Monitoring:** Tracking battery health over time to predict replacement needs.

### Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) & Operator Interface

* **Intuitive User Interface (UI):** A clear and easy-to-use interface for drawing paths, monitoring UGV status, and providing commands. This could be a tablet, PC, or even a handheld remote.
* **Visual Feedback:** Real-time visualization of the UGV's position, planned path, detected obstacles, and battery status on the operator interface.
* **Auditory Alerts:** Distinct auditory signals for various events (e.g., obstacle detected, low battery, mission complete).
* **Emergency Stop:** A prominent and easily accessible physical and/or software emergency stop mechanism for immediate shutdown.
* **Manual Control Override:** The ability for the operator to seamlessly take manual control of the UGV at any time.
* **Mission Logging:** Recording mission data (path traveled, events, battery usage) for analysis and debugging.

### Safety & Reliability

* **Fail-Safe Mechanisms:** Designing the system to default to a safe state in case of system failures (e.g., loss of communication, sensor malfunction).
* **Robust Communication Link:** A reliable and secure wireless communication link between the UGV and the operator station.
* **Environmental Robustness:** Ability to operate in various weather conditions (rain, dust, temperature extremes) if required for the application.
* **Redundancy in Critical Systems:** Implementing backup systems for critical components (e.g., power, communication) to prevent single points of failure.
* **Cybersecurity:** Protection against unauthorized access or manipulation of the UGV's systems and data.

### System Architecture (Implicit)

* **Modular Design:** A modular software and hardware architecture to allow for easy upgrades, maintenance, and integration of new features or sensors.
* **Scalability:** The ability to scale the system for different UGV sizes or additional functionalities in the future.
* **Simulation Environment:** A simulation environment for testing and validating algorithms and mission plans before deployment on the physical UGV. This is crucial for rapid development and safe testing.
