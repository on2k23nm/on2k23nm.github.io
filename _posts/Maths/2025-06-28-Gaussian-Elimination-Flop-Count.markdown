Gaussian elimination is the workhorse of linear algebra, a systematic method to solve systems of linear equations. When applied to an $$n \times (n+1)$$ augmented matrix (representing $$n$$ equations with $$n$$ variables), it proceeds in two distinct phases: 
* **Forward Phase** - also known as _Gaussian elimination to row echelon form (REF)_ and the 
* **Backward Phase** - often called _backward substitution_ or _Gauss-Jordan elimination for the full reduction (reduced row echelon form (RREF))_.

Understanding the computational cost, measured in floating-point operations (flops), reveals why the forward phase dominates for large systems.

Let's dissect each phase with an $$n \times (n+1)$$ augmented matrix $$A = [A' \vert \mathbf{b}]$$, where $$A'$$ is an $$n \times n$$ matrix and $$\mathbf{b}$$ is an $$n \times 1$$ column vector. We assume that $$A'$$ is invertible, which ensures a unique solution and non-zero pivots.

### Phase 1: The Forward Elimination (_Gaussian Elimination to REF_)

The goal of this phase is to transform the augmented matrix into an **echelon form**. This means creating an upper triangular form for the $$n \times n$$ part of the matrix, with leading 1s (pivots) and zeros below them.

We proceed column by column, from left to right (from column 1 to column $$n$$).

**For each column $$j$$ from $$1$$ to $$n$$:**

1.  **Pivot Selection and Normalization (Making the Leading 1):**
    * **Find Pivot:** Locate the first non-zero entry in column $$j$$ in or below row $$j$$. (In practice, for numerical stability, one might choose the largest absolute value in the column and perform row swapping, known as "partial pivoting." We'll ignore the flop cost of row swaps themselves, as they are minor compared to arithmetic operations).
    * **Move Pivot Row:** Swap the current row $$j$$ with the row containing the chosen pivot, if necessary. (0 flops for arithmetic operations).
    * **Normalize Pivot Row:** Divide the entire pivot row (row $$j$$) by the pivot element $$A_{jj}$$. This makes the pivot $$A_{jj}$$ equal to 1.
        * This division affects $$A_{jj}$$ (makes it 1) and all elements to its right in row $$j$$, including the element in the augmented column. There are $$(n - j + 1)$$ elements in the coefficient matrix part and 1 in the augmented part, totaling $$(n - j + 2)$$ elements to divide.
        * **Flops:** $$(n - j + 1)$$ divisions (for the coefficient part) + 1 division (for the augmented part) $$\approx (n - j + 2)$$ divisions.

2.  **Elimination (Creating Zeros Below the Pivot):**
    * For each row $$i$$ *below* the pivot row (i.e., for $$i$$ from $$j+1$$ to $$n$$):
        * We want to make $$A_{ij}$$ (the element in column $$j$$ of row $$i$$) zero.
        * Calculate the **multiplier** $$m = A_{ij}$$. (Note: if we didn't normalize the pivot to 1, the multiplier would be $$A_{ij} / A_{jj}$$. For simplicity in flop counting, we often consider the operations if we effectively zero out the element.)
        * Subtract $$m$$ times the pivot row (row $$j$$) from row $$i$$.
            * This operation is: $$Row_i \leftarrow Row_i - m \cdot Row_j$$.
            * This affects elements from column $$j+1$$ to column $$n$$ and the augmented column $$(n+1)$$. There are $$(n - j)$$ elements in the coefficient matrix part and 1 in the augmented part, totaling $$(n - j + 1)$$ elements.
            * For each of these $$(n - j + 1)$$ elements, we perform 1 multiplication and 1 subtraction.
            * **Flops per row $$i$$:** $$2 \times (n - j + 1)$$ flops.
    * Since there are $$(n - j)$$ rows below the pivot row (from $$j+1$$ to $$n$$), the total flops for elimination in column $$j$$ are:
        * **Flops:** $$(n - j) \times 2(n - j + 1)$$ flops.

**Total Flops for Forward Phase (Summing for all columns $$j$$):**

Let's sum these up. The divisions for normalization are a lower-order term compared to the multiplications and subtractions for elimination, so we often focus on the latter.

Approximate flops for elimination (for column $$j$$): $$2(n-j)(n-j+1)$$.
Let $$k = n-j$$. As $$j$$ goes from $$1$$ to $$n-1$$ (we don't need to eliminate for the last column if $$A'$$ is invertible), $$k$$ goes from $$n-1$$ down to $$0$$.

Total Flops $$\approx \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 2(n-j)(n-j+1)$$
$$= \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2k(k+1)$$ (We can start from $$k=0$$ as it adds 0 to the sum)
$$= 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k^2 + k)$$
$$= 2 \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k \right)$$

Using sum formulas: $$\sum_{k=1}^{N} k = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$$ and $$\sum_{k=1}^{N} k^2 = \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}$$

Total Flops $$\approx 2 \left( \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} + \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \right)$$
$$\approx 2 \left( \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1) + 3(n-1)n}{6} \right)$$
$$\approx 2 \left( \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1+3)}{6} \right)$$
$$\approx 2 \left( \frac{(n-1)n(2n+2)}{6} \right)$$
$$\approx 2 \left( \frac{2n(n-1)(n+1)}{6} \right)$$
$$\approx \frac{2n(n^2-1)}{3} = \frac{2n^3 - 2n}{3}$$

For large $$n$$, this is approximately $$\frac{2}{3}n^3$$. The normalization divisions add roughly $$O(n^2)$$ flops, which are negligible compared to $$O(n^3)$$.

### Phase 2: The Backward Elimination (Gauss-Jordan or Backward Substitution to RREF)

Once the matrix is in echelon form, the goal is to transform it into **reduced echelon form**. This means:
* All leading 1s (pivots).
* Zeros *below* and *above* each pivot.

We achieve this by working column by column, from right to left (from column $$n$$ down to column $$1$$).

**For each column $$j$$ from $$n$$ down to $$1$$:**

1.  **Ensuring Leading 1 (Already Done in Forward Phase if not using Gauss-Jordan all at once):**
    * If the forward phase normalized pivots to 1, then $$A_{jj}$$ is already 1. No operations needed here. (If we were doing a full Gauss-Jordan *without* normalization in the forward phase, we'd normalize here, which would be $$O(n)$$ flops per column). We assume pivots are already 1 from the end of Phase 1.

2.  **Elimination (Creating Zeros Above the Pivot):**
    * For each row $$i$$ *above* the pivot row (i.e., for $$i$$ from $$1$$ to $$j-1$$):
        * We want to make $$A_{ij}$$ (the element in column $$j$$ of row $$i$$) zero.
        * Calculate the **multiplier** $$m = A_{ij}$$.
        * Subtract $$m$$ times the pivot row (row $$j$$) from row $$i$$.
            * This operation is: $$Row_i \leftarrow Row_i - m \cdot Row_j$$.
            * Crucially, since we are working from right to left, the elements in row $$j$$ to the *left* of the pivot $$A_{jj}$$ are already zero. Thus, this operation only affects elements to the *right* of column $$j$$ and the augmented column $$(n+1)$$. There is 1 element to affect (the augmented part), as all elements to its left become 0. No, wait, it affects only the augmented column element.
            * Let's re-evaluate. The elements in row $$j$$ from column $$1$$ to $$j-1$$ are zero. The elements in row $$j$$ that are non-zero are $$A_{jj}$$ (which is 1) and elements $$A_{j, j+1}, \dots, A_{j, n}, A_{j, n+1}$$. When we multiply row $$j$$ by $$m$$ and subtract it from row $$i$$, we are updating $$A_{i, \text{col}}$$ for $$\text{col} = j+1, \dots, n+1$$.
            * This means we are doing operations on $$(n - j + 1)$$ elements.
            * For each of these $$(n - j + 1)$$ elements, we perform 1 multiplication and 1 subtraction.
            * **Flops per row $$i$$:** $$2 \times (n - j + 1)$$ flops.
    * Since there are $$(j - 1)$$ rows above the pivot row (from $$1$$ to $$j-1$$), the total flops for elimination in column $$j$$ are:
        * **Flops:** $$(j - 1) \times 2(n - j + 1)$$ flops.

**Total Flops for Backward Phase (Summing for all columns $$j$$):**

Total Flops $$\approx \sum_{j=1}^{n} (j-1) \cdot 2(n-j+1)$$
We can ignore $$j=1$$ as $$(1-1)=0$$. So, sum from $$j=2$$ to $$n$$.

Let $$k = j-1$$. As $$j$$ goes from $$2$$ to $$n$$, $$k$$ goes from $$1$$ to $$n-1$$.
The term $$(n-j+1)$$ becomes $$(n-(k+1)+1) = (n-k)$$.

Total Flops $$\approx \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2k(n-k)$$
$$= 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (nk - k^2)$$
$$= 2 \left( n \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k - \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^2 \right)$$

Using sum formulas again:
Total Flops $$\approx 2 \left( n \frac{(n-1)n}{2} - \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} \right)$$
$$= 2 \left( \frac{n^2(n-1)}{2} - \frac{n(n-1)(2n-1)}{6} \right)$$
$$= 2n(n-1) \left( \frac{n}{2} - \frac{2n-1}{6} \right)$$
$$= 2n(n-1) \left( \frac{3n - (2n-1)}{6} \right)$$
$$= 2n(n-1) \left( \frac{3n - 2n + 1}{6} \right)$$
$$= 2n(n-1) \left( \frac{n + 1}{6} \right)$$
$$= \frac{2n(n^2-1)}{6} = \frac{n(n^2-1)}{3} = \frac{n^3 - n}{3}$$

For large $$n$$, this is approximately $$\frac{1}{3}n^3$$.

**Wait, this is different from $$n^2$$! What's going on?**

The discrepancy arises from the common interpretation of "backward phase" and the specific algorithm used.

The $$O(n^2)$$ approximation for the backward phase usually refers specifically to **backward substitution** on an *already triangular* system (where the coefficient matrix is already upper triangular with 1s on the diagonal). If the forward phase gets you to:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \star & \star & \dots & \star & | & b_1 \\
0 & 1 & \star & \dots & \star & | & b_2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & \star & | & b_3 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & | & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & | & b_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Then backward substitution to find $$x_i$$ values:

* $$x_n = b_n$$ (0 flops)
* $$x_{n-1} = b_{n-1} - A_{n-1,n}x_n$$ (1 mult, 1 sub = 2 flops)
* $$x_{n-2} = b_{n-2} - A_{n-2,n-1}x_{n-1} - A_{n-2,n}x_n$$ (2 mult, 2 sub = 4 flops)
* ...
* $$x_i = b_i - \sum_{k=i+1}^n A_{ik}x_k$$ (approx. $$2(n-i)$$ flops)

Summing these up: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 2(n-i) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = n(n-1) \approx n^2$$.

**This $$n^2$$ applies if you're only solving for the variables ($$x_1, \dots, x_n$$) given the echelon form, not necessarily transforming the entire matrix to reduced echelon form by eliminating above pivots.**

**If the question implies full reduction to *reduced echelon form* (Gauss-Jordan), including making zeros above the pivots, then my earlier $$\frac{1}{3}n^3$$ calculation is more accurate for that specific step.**

However, in many contexts, especially when discussing "Gaussian Elimination" as a two-phase process for solving systems, the $$O(n^3)$$ is for getting to echelon form, and $$O(n^2)$$ is for the subsequent *backward substitution* to find the solution vector. The additional operations to get zeros above the pivots, while part of "reduced echelon form," are sometimes considered less dominant or folded into more general $$O(n^3)$$ calculations for Gauss-Jordan.

**Revisiting the $$O(n^2)$$ Approximation for the Backward Phase to Reduced Echelon Form**

The $$n^2$$ estimate for the backward phase, when applied to obtaining *reduced echelon form*, usually comes from a slightly different perspective, often simplified. If we consider clearing *each* element above the pivot:

For column $$j$$ (from $$n$$ down to $$1$$):
* We're zeroing out $$(j-1)$$ entries above the pivot.
* For each entry $$A_{ij}$$ (where $$i < j$$), we perform $$Row_i \leftarrow Row_i - A_{ij} \cdot Row_j$$.
* Since row $$j$$ has been processed and its elements to the left of $$A_{jj}$$ are zero, this operation primarily affects the right-hand side constant of row $$i$$.
* This is typically 1 multiplication ($$A_{ij} \cdot x_j$$) and 1 subtraction ($$b_i - \dots$$). So, 2 flops.
* Total for column $$j$$: $$(j-1) \times 2 = 2(j-1)$$ flops.

Summing these from $$j=1$$ to $$n$$: $$\sum_{j=1}^n 2(j-1) = 2 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k = 2 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = n(n-1) = n^2 - n$$.

**This is the calculation that leads to the $$O(n^2)$$ estimate for the backward phase when aiming for reduced echelon form.** My previous $$\frac{1}{3}n^3$$ derivation for the backward phase was more comprehensive if we're considering transformations of the entire matrix, while the $$n^2$$ derivation focuses on the necessary arithmetic operations on the right-hand side or when the pivot column itself is used for clearing. The simpler $$n^2$$ model is common in contexts where the detailed $$n^3$$ forward phase is contrasted with a less complex "solution-finding" backward phase.

### The Unbalanced Effort: A Quick Look at the Numbers

To truly appreciate the dominance of the forward phase for larger systems, let's look at the fraction of total operations (flops) that the backward phase contributes. We use the approximate formulas: Forward Flops $$\approx \frac{2}{3}n^3$$ and Backward Flops $$\approx n^2$$.

The fraction of total flops in the backward phase is:
$$\text{Fraction} = \frac{\text{Backward Flops}}{\text{Forward Flops} + \text{Backward Flops}} = \frac{n^2}{\frac{2}{3}n^3 + n^2} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}n + 1}$$

| $$n$$    | Forward Flops ($$\approx \frac{2}{3}n^3$$) | Backward Flops ($$\approx n^2$$) | Total Flops ($$\approx \frac{2}{3}n^3 + n^2$$) | Fraction in Backward Phase ($$\frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}n + 1}$$) | Percentage in Backward Phase |
| :----- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| **30** | $$18,000$$                            | $$900$$                       | $$18,900$$                                     | $$\frac{1}{21} \approx 0.0476$$                           | **4.76%** |
| **300**| $$18,000,000$$                        | $$90,000$$                    | $$18,090,000$$                                 | $$\frac{1}{201} \approx 0.004975$$                        | **0.50%** |
| **3000**| $$18,000,000,000$$                    | $$9,000,000$$                 | $$18,009,000,000$$                             | $$\frac{1}{2001} \approx 0.00049975$$                     | **0.05%** |

As $$n$$ grows, the fraction of the total computation time spent in the backward phase rapidly shrinks. This table strikingly illustrates why the cubic term of the forward phase utterly dominates the total computational cost for large-scale linear systems.

### Conclusion:

* **Forward Phase (to Echelon Form):** Approximately $$\frac{2}{3}n^3$$ flops. This involves creating zeros below pivots.
* **Backward Phase (to Reduced Echelon Form / Backward Substitution):** Approximately $$n^2$$ flops. This involves creating zeros above pivots and solving for the variables.

The quadratic complexity of the backward phase stands in stark contrast to the cubic complexity of the forward phase, making it the less computationally demanding part of Gaussian elimination for large systems. This is why when you hear about the "complexity of Gaussian elimination," the $$O(n^3)$$ term almost always refers to the forward reduction.
