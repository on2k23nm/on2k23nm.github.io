One of the subtle yet powerful features of C++ is how it allows implicit conversions — not just between built-in types like int → double, but even between class types, provided certain conditions are met.

💡 First-Principles Insight:
Any constructor that can be called with a single argument can define an implicit conversion from that argument type to the class type. Such constructors are called "converting constructors".

For example:
{% highlight ruby %}
class Username {
public:
 Username(const std::string& name); // Converting constructor
};
{% endhighlight %}

This allows you to pass a std::string where a Username is expected, and the compiler will automatically construct a temporary Username object:

{% highlight ruby %}
void greetUser(const Username& user);
std::string name = "alice42";
greetUser(name); // std::string → Username ✅ (single implicit conversion)
{% endhighlight %}

But here's the catch 🪤:

❌ C++ allows only one class-type conversion in an expression.

If two are needed (e.g., const char* → std::string → Username), the call will not compile:

{% highlight ruby %}
greetUser("alice42"); // ❌ Error: requires two conversions
{% endhighlight %}

Here’s how to fix it by making one conversion explicit:

{% highlight ruby %}
greetUser(Username("alice42")); // ✅ Explicit
{% endhighlight %}

✅ This ensures clarity, control, and compile-time safety — a hallmark of C++'s design philosophy rooted in zero-cost abstractions.
