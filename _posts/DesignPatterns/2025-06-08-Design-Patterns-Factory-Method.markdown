üìò **_Learn how to create objects without specifying the exact class, making your code dramatically more flexible and open to extension._**

Welcome to the first deep-dive in our series on Software Design Patterns! If you're coming from our [series overview](./Design-Patterns.html), you know our goal is to move beyond theory and into practical application.  
And there's no better place to start than with one of the most fundamental creational patterns: the **Factory Method**.

Have you ever written a piece of code that needs to create an object, but the _exact type_ of object needed depends on user input, a configuration file, or some other runtime condition?  
Your first instinct might be to use a large `if-else` or `switch` statement. While this works, it creates a maintenance nightmare. Every time you add a new object type, you have to modify that monolithic block of code, violating the
[Open/Closed Principle](../../../../software-design/2025/06/02/SOLID-Design-Open-Closed-Principle.html).

The Factory Method pattern is the elegant solution to this exact problem. In this guide, we'll break down the problem, implement the pattern step-by-step in C++, and discuss when it's the perfect tool for the job.

### ‚ùó The Problem: The Rigid Object Creator

Let's imagine we're building a logistics management application. The core logic needs to plan a delivery, which involves creating a transport vehicle object. For now, we can deliver by truck or by ship.
A naive implementation might look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Our "Products"
class ITransport {
public:
    virtual ~ITransport() {}
    virtual void deliver() const = 0;
};

class Truck : public ITransport {
public:
    void deliver() const override {
        std::cout << "Delivering by land in a truck." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Ship : public ITransport {
public:
    void deliver() const override {
        std::cout << "Delivering by sea in a ship." << std::endl;
    }
};

// The problematic client code
enum class TransportType { TRUCK, SHIP };

class Logistics {
public:
    // This is the code that violates the Open/Closed Principle
    void planDelivery(TransportType type) {
        ITransport* transport;
        if (type == TransportType::TRUCK) {
            transport = new Truck();
        } else if (type == TransportType::SHIP) {
            transport = new Ship();
        } else {
            // What happens if we add a new type? Nothing. This is brittle.
            transport = nullptr;
        }

        if (transport) {
            std::cout << "Logistics: Planning the delivery." << std::endl;
            transport->deliver();
            delete transport;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Logistics logistics;
    logistics.planDelivery(TransportType::TRUCK);
    logistics.planDelivery(TransportType::SHIP);
    return 0;
}
````

This code has a major flaw. The `planDelivery` method is tightly coupled to the concrete `Truck` and `Ship` classes. If we want to add `Airplane` transport tomorrow, we have to go back and modify the `Logistics` class's `if-else` statement. This is not scalable or maintainable.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è The Solution: The Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern solves this by delegating the responsibility of object creation to subclasses.

> **GoF Intent**: _"Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses."_

In simple terms, the base `Logistics` class will now have an abstract method called `createTransport()`. It won't know or care how a transport vehicle is made; it will simply call this method. Then, concrete subclasses like `RoadLogistics` and `SeaLogistics` will provide the actual implementation, returning a `Truck` or `Ship`, respectively.

---

### üß© The Participants

- **Product (`ITransport`)**:  
  The common interface for all objects that the factory method will create.

- **ConcreteProduct (`Truck`, `Ship`)**:  
  The actual classes that implement the `Product` interface.

- **Creator (`Logistics`)**:  
  A class that declares the factory method, which returns an object of type `Product`.  
  It can also contain the core business logic that relies on the created product.

- **ConcreteCreator (`RoadLogistics`, `SeaLogistics`)**:  
  A class that overrides the factory method to return an instance of a specific `ConcreteProduct`.

---

### üß± C++ Implementation: Step-by-Step

Let's refactor our logistics application using the Factory Method.

---

#### üîß Step 1: Define the Product Interface and Concrete Products

This part remains the same. We need a common interface for our products.
```cpp
// ITransport.h
#pragma once
#include <iostream>

// The Product interface
class ITransport {
public:
    virtual ~ITransport() {}
    virtual void deliver() const = 0;
};

// A Concrete Product
class Truck : public ITransport {
public:
    void deliver() const override {
        std::cout << "Delivering by land in a truck." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Another Concrete Product
class Ship : public ITransport {
public:
    void deliver() const override {
        std::cout << "Delivering by sea in a ship." << std::endl;
    }
};
````

#### üî® Step 2: Define the Creator and Concrete Creators

This is where the magic happens. The base `Logistics` class becomes abstract and defines the factory method.

```cpp
// Logistics.h
#pragma once
#include "ITransport.h"

// The Creator class declares the factory method
class Logistics {
public:
    virtual ~Logistics() {}
    // The Factory Method
    virtual ITransport* createTransport() const = 0;

    // Core business logic (no longer coupled to concrete classes)
    void planDelivery() const {
        ITransport* transport = this->createTransport();
        std::cout << "Creator: Core logic is working with the product." << std::endl;
        transport->deliver();
        delete transport;
    }
};

// A Concrete Creator
class RoadLogistics : public Logistics {
public:
    ITransport* createTransport() const override {
        return new Truck();
    }
};

// Another Concrete Creator
class SeaLogistics : public Logistics {
public:
    ITransport* createTransport() const override {
        return new Ship();
    }
};
````

#### üßë‚Äçüíª Step 3: The Client Code

The client code now decides which "factory" to use. Notice how clean and decoupled it is.

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include "Logistics.h"

void clientCode(const Logistics& creator) {
    std::cout << "Client: I'm not aware of the creator's concrete class, but it still works." << std::endl;
    creator.planDelivery();
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "App: Launched with RoadLogistics." << std::endl;
    RoadLogistics roadCreator;
    clientCode(roadCreator);

    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "App: Launched with SeaLogistics." << std::endl;
    SeaLogistics seaCreator;
    clientCode(seaCreator);

    // What if we add AirLogistics? The clientCode function doesn't need to change!

    return 0;
}
````
üñ•Ô∏è **Output:**

```
App: Launched with RoadLogistics.
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's concrete class, but it still works.
Creator: Core logic is working with the product.
Delivering by land in a truck.

App: Launched with SeaLogistics.
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's concrete class, but it still works.
Creator: Core logic is working with the product.
Delivering by sea in a ship.
```

We have successfully decoupled the business logic in `planDelivery` from the creation of the transport objects. If we add an `AirLogistics` class that creates an `Airplane` object, the `planDelivery` and `clientCode` functions require **zero modifications**.

### üß∞ When Should You Use the Factory Method?

- **When you don't know the exact types of objects your code will work with beforehand.**  
  The pattern allows you to defer the choice of class to your clients or to runtime conditions.

- **When you want to provide a way for users of your library or framework to extend its internal components.**  
  Users can provide their own `ConcreteCreator` to produce custom objects that work with your framework's logic.

- **When you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of creating new ones each time.**  
  A factory method can be modified to look for an existing object in a pool before creating a new one.

### ü§î Pros and Cons

- **Pros:**
  - Avoids tight coupling between the creator and concrete products.
  - [**Single Responsibility Principle**](../../../../software-design/2025/06/02/SOLID-Design-Single-Responsibility-Principle.html): You move the object creation code into one place, making it easier to maintain.
  - [**Open/Closed Principle**](../../../../software-design/2025/06/02/SOLID-Design-Open-Closed-Principle.html): You can introduce new types of products without modifying existing client or creator code.
- **Cons:**
  - The code can become more complex as you need to introduce a new hierarchy of creator classes.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Factory Method is your first major step towards writing truly flexible and decoupled object-oriented code. By delegating the responsibility of object creation to subclasses, you empower your system to be extended without modification, adhering perfectly to the Open/Closed Principle.

Now that you've mastered creating objects on-demand, what if you need to create entire _families_ of related objects?
