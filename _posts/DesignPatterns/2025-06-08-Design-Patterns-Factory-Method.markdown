### Introduction

In a complex, full-stack distributed software system—such as autonomous driving platforms—object creation happens everywhere: for instance, inside hundreds of ROS 2 nodes that together handle sensing, localization, perception, planning, and control tasks. The complexity can be immense, with hundreds of packages and millions of lines of code.

Imagine, if even one of those nodes hard-codes a constructor call such as `new VelodyneLidar()`, the entire stack becomes welded to a single hardware vendor. Every change to a sensor, whether for an upgrade, a cost reduction, or to switch to a different brand, forces a risky hunt-and-replace operation through the codebase.

The **Factory Method** pattern dissolves that rigidity by hiding the `new` behind an interface, allowing the robot to swap out LIDARs, cameras, or simulators without touching high-level logic. This promotes a modular and flexible system design that is essential for long-term project viability.

This post is a collection of my personal notes and practical examples, drawn from real-world work on a autonomous vehicle software stack, showing how to apply the Factory Method pattern in modern C++. It is intended as a serious, practical reference for structure, use-cases, and trade-offs, not a purely educational exercise.

### The Core Problem: Rigidity in Object Creation

Let's consider the perception system of an autonomous vehicle. The system needs to process data from various types of sensors, such as LiDAR, cameras, or RADAR. A vehicle configuration might change based on the model, trim level, or available hardware.

If your high-level perception logic directly instantiates sensor objects, your code might look like this:

```cpp
// High-level logic is now dependent on a specific LiDAR class
auto sensor = new VelodyneLiDAR();
sensor->initialize();
auto pointCloud = sensor->scan();
```

This presents an immediate problem. What happens when you need to support a different sensor, like an OusterLiDAR, or switch to a simulated sensor for testing? You would have to find and modify every place where `new VelodyneLiDAR()` is called. This violates the **Open/Closed Principle**—_your system should be open for extension (adding new sensors) but closed for modification (changing the perception logic)_. Direct instantiation makes your high-level modules dependent on low-level concrete details, which is the opposite of a robust architecture.

### The Solution: Deferring Instantiation to Subclasses

The **Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides a solution to the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact, concrete class of the object that will be created. Its primary principle is to **delegate the responsibility of instantiation**.

The pattern solves this by defining an interface for creating an object but letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It introduces a method (the "factory method") that is responsible for creating objects, moving the direct `new` call out of the high-level client logic and into a dedicated, overridable function. The specific type of factory provided to the client at runtime then determines the specific type of object that gets created.

#### First Principles Intent

The fundamental goal is to **decouple the client** (the code that needs an object) **from the concrete product** (the specific object being created). This is essential in systems where a component must operate without being tied to the implementation details of the objects it needs.

An application's core logic, or "client," should operate on an abstract interface for the objects it uses (like an `ISensor`) and request them from a factory, also through an abstract interface (like a `SensorFactory`). The client doesn't know, nor does it care, which specific sensor it gets, allowing the system to be extended with new types of sensors without changing the client code.

### Structural Components

The pattern involves four key roles, which work together to achieve this decoupling:

  * **Product Interface**: An abstract interface for the objects the factory method creates. This defines the common set of operations that all concrete products must support. In our example, this is `ISensor`.

  * **Concrete Product**: A specific class that implements the Product Interface. This is the actual object that is created. In our example, this would be `VelodyneLIDAR`.

  ![alt text](/assets/images/DesignPatterns/Images/Factory/classISensor__inherit__graph.png)

  * **Creator**: An abstract class that declares the factory method. The factory method's return type is the Product Interface. This class may also contain core logic that operates on the abstract product. In our example, this is `SensorFactory`.

  * **Concrete Creator**: A specific class that overrides the factory method to return an instance of a specific Concrete Product. This class contains the knowledge of how to instantiate one particular product. In our example, this is `VelodyneFactory`.

  ![alt text](/assets/images/DesignPatterns/Images/Factory/classSensorFactory__inherit__graph.png)

### The Abstraction Layer: The Public Contract

This layer defines the common interfaces that the rest of the system will depend on. It represents a contract that guarantees certain functionalities without exposing the implementation.

**The Product Interface**  
The "Product" is the object being created. The interface defines the set of operations that all concrete products must support. The client code will interact with the product exclusively through this interface, typically via a pointer or reference, to ensure it is not tied to any specific implementation.

```cpp
#ifndef I_SENSOR_HPP
#define I_SENSOR_HPP

// This abstract struct defines the common interface for all sensor products.
// The client code will only ever hold a pointer to an ISensor.
struct ISensor {
    virtual ~ISensor() = default;

    // Pure virtual functions define the contract for all concrete sensors.
    virtual void initialize() = 0;
    virtual void readData() = 0;
};

#endif // I_SENSOR_HPP
```

**The Creator Interface**  
The "Creator" (or Factory) declares the factory method, which is the method responsible for creating a Product object. This method's return type is the abstract Product interface (`ISensor`), which conceals the concrete product type from the client.

```cpp
#ifndef SENSOR_FACTORY_HPP
#define SENSOR_FACTORY_HPP

#include <memory>
#include "ISensor.hpp"

// This abstract struct defines the interface for all factory creators.
// Its primary role is to declare the factory method.
struct SensorFactory {
    virtual ~SensorFactory() = default;

    // The "Factory Method". It returns a unique pointer to the abstract product.
    // This decouples the client from the ownership and specific type of the sensor.
    virtual std::unique_ptr<ISensor> createSensor() const = 0;
};

#endif // SENSOR_FACTORY_HPP
```

### The Implementation Layer: The Private Details

This layer contains the concrete classes that implement the abstract interfaces. In a well-designed library, these classes would be internal details, not exposed as part of the public API.

**The Concrete Product**  

![alt text](/assets/images/DesignPatterns/Images/Factory/classVelodyneLiDAR__inherit__graph.png) 


A **Concrete Product** is a specific implementation of the abstract **Product** interface. In this example, `VelodyneLIDAR` is a concrete product that implements the `ISensor` interface. It contains the actual implementation logic for the sensor's functionality, such as initializing hardware and reading data. Each concrete product corresponds to a specific object type that the system can create.

Below shows the `VelodyneLIDAR.hpp` header file which contains the class definition for `VelodyneLIDAR` and its methods that override the virtual functions of `ISensor`. 

```cpp
// VelodyneLIDAR.hpp
#ifndef VELODYNE_LIDAR_HPP
#define VELODYNE_LIDAR_HPP

#include "ISensor.hpp"
#include <iostream>

// A concrete implementation of the ISensor interface.
// This class is an internal implementation detail.
class VelodyneLIDAR : public ISensor {
public:
    void initialize() override;
    void readData() override;
};

#endif // VELODYNE_LIDAR_HPP
```

The `VelodyneLIDAR.cpp` source file contains the detailed implementation of these methods, including the specific steps for initializing the LiDAR and reading point-cloud data. This code is considered a private detail, as client code should only interact with the `ISensor` interface, not with this specific implementation.

```cpp
// VelodyneLIDAR.cpp
#include "VelodyneLiDAR.hpp"   // self declaration
#include <iostream>            // std::cout

void VelodyneLiDAR::initialize()
{
    // TODO: production steps
    //   • open UDP socket on port 2368
    //   • parse calibration XML (sin/cos tables)
    //   • spawn packet-capture thread
    std::cout << "Initializing Velodyne LiDAR...\n";
}

void VelodyneLiDAR::readData()
{
    // TODO: production steps
    //   • receive UDP packets
    //   • convert azimuth + distance to XYZ
    //   • publish as PointCloud2 to perception pipeline
    std::cout << "Reading Velodyne point-cloud data...\n";
}

```

**The Concrete Creator**    

The files `VelodyneFactory.hpp` and `VelodyneFactory.cpp` implement a **Concrete Factory** within the larger **Abstract Factory** design pattern. This concrete creator is responsible for instantiating a specific concrete product, in this case, a `VelodyneLiDAR` object. The implementation of `VelodyneFactory` demonstrates key principles of the Factory pattern:

![alt text](/assets/images/DesignPatterns/Images/Factory/classVelodyneFactory__inherit__graph.png)

**Abstraction and Decoupling** 

The client code works with the abstract `SensorFactory` and `ISensor` interfaces, not the concrete `VelodyneFactory` or `VelodyneLiDAR` classes. 

```cpp
// VelodyneFactory.hpp
#ifndef VELODYNE_FACTORY_HPP
#define VELODYNE_FACTORY_HPP

#include <memory>
#include "SensorFactory.hpp"

// Forward declaration — keeps concrete header private
class VelodyneLiDAR;

class VelodyneFactory final : public SensorFactory
{
public:
    [[nodiscard]]
    std::unique_ptr<ISensor> createSensor() const override;
};

#endif // VELODYNE_FACTORY_HPP
```

The use of a **forward declaration** for `VelodyneLiDAR` in the `VelodyneFactory.hpp` header file is a crucial detail that ensures the client code remains decoupled from the implementation details of `VelodyneLiDAR`. This means that client code that includes `VelodyneFactory.hpp` does not need to know any specifics about how `VelodyneLiDAR` is implemented, which promotes a stable and flexible API.

**Encapsulation of Creation Logic**   

`VelodyneFactory.cpp` source file is the **only place** in the code where the `VelodyneLiDAR.hpp` header is included and the `VelodyneLiDAR` object is directly instantiated. This centralizes the knowledge of how to create a specific type of sensor within a single file, making the system easier to maintain and modify. If the way a `VelodyneLiDAR` is created needs to change, the modification is confined to this single file, and no other parts of the codebase are affected.

```cpp
// VelodyneFactory.cpp
#include "VelodyneFactory.hpp"
#include "VelodyneLIDAR.hpp" // The factory needs the concrete product header.

// This is the only place where the concrete VelodyneLIDAR is instantiated.
std::unique_ptr<ISensor> VelodyneFactory::createSensor() const {
    return std::make_unique<VelodyneLIDAR>();
}
```

**Interfaces might change**

For the system to remain flexible, the interfaces themselves should be stable. However, when a change is necessary, clients must be recompiled. This can occur due to changes in either the product interface or the factory interface.

* **Product Interface Changes**: A product interface might need to change to add new functionality or to adapt to new requirements for the product's behavior. The product is responsible for its own functionality, which is a different concern from how it is created. For example, the `ISensor` interface could be modified to include new methods that do not affect the `SensorFactory` interface.
    * **Adding a Method for Specific Product Functionality**: The `ISensor` interface could be changed to add a new method, such as `getSensorStatus()`, to allow the client to retrieve the current operational status of a sensor. This change affects the product's interface and requires all concrete product implementations (e.g., `VelodyneLiDAR`, `OusterLiDAR`) to be updated, but it does not require any changes to the factory interfaces.
    * **Adding Methods for a New Data Type**: A `createPointCloud()` method could be added to the `ISensor` interface to standardize the way different sensors output point cloud data. The `ISensor` interface is changed, and all concrete sensors must be updated to implement this method, but the factory's role remains unchanged.

* **Factory Interface Changes**: A factory interface might need to change even if the product interface does not, typically to accommodate new creation logic or to offer different variations of a product. The factory is responsible for the creation process, which is a different concern from the product's functionality. For example, a `SensorFactory` interface could be modified to include new methods that do not affect the `ISensor` product interface.
    * **Adding a Method for Specific Product Creation**: The factory interface could be changed to add a new method, such as `createSensor(const std::string& config_file)`, to allow the client to create a sensor using a configuration file instead of relying on hardcoded logic. This change affects the factory's interface but does not require any changes to the `ISensor` interface.
    * **Adding Methods for Caching or Pooling**: A `createCachedSensor()` method could be added to the `SensorFactory` interface. This method might return an `ISensor` object from a pre-allocated pool, improving performance. The `ISensor` interface itself remains unchanged, but the factory's role has expanded to include resource management.

### The Client and Configuration Logic

The client is the part of the system that needs a product object but should not be coupled to its concrete class. The provided example demonstrates a realistic scenario where the choice of which product to create is driven by a runtime configuration.

```cpp
// This function simulates reading a system configuration to select a sensor.
// In a real system, this would come from a config file.
std::string getSensorConfiguration() {
    // Change this value to "Camera", "Radar", "OusterLiDAR", etc. to see the effect.
    return "VelodyneLiDAR";
}

// The client code only knows about the abstract factory and sensor.
// This function remains unchanged regardless of which sensor is used.
void runPerception(const SensorFactory& factory) {
    // 1. Ask the factory for *any* sensor that satisfies ISensor
    std::unique_ptr<ISensor> sensor = factory.createSensor();
    // 2. Use the sensor via the abstract interface
    sensor->initialize();
    sensor->readData();
}


int main()
{
    std::unique_ptr<SensorFactory> factory;
    std::string sensorModel = getSensorConfiguration();

    // The configuration logic now selects the appropriate factory
    // based on the system's needs.
    if (sensorModel == "VelodyneLiDAR") {
        factory = std::make_unique<VelodyneFactory>();
    } else if (sensorModel == "OusterLiDAR") {
        factory = std::make_unique<OusterFactory>();
    } else if (sensorModel == "SimulatedLiDAR") {
        factory = std::make_unique<SimulatedLiDARFactory>();
    } else if (sensorModel == "Camera") {
        factory = std::make_unique<CameraFactory>();
    } else if (sensorModel == "Radar") {
        factory = std::make_unique<RadarFactory>();
    } else if (sensorModel == "Imu") {
        factory = std::make_unique<ImuFactory>();
    } else if (sensorModel == "Sonar") {
        factory = std::make_unique<SonarFactory>();
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Error: Unknown sensor configuration: "
            << sensorModel << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    runPerception(*factory);

    return 0;
}
```

### The Core Logic Flow

Here’s how a client can stay blissfully unaware of which concrete sensor it’s using, yet still get the right one at runtime.

1. **The Composition Root and Object Graph Construction**: The process begins in the application's setup phase, the **`main()`** function, which acts as the **composition root**. A well-structured program performs two distinct activities: first building the object graph, then running the application logic. The composition root is the **one place** where the initial building of the object graph occurs. This happens by:
    1.  Determining the runtime needs, for example, by calling `getSensorConfiguration()`.
    2.  Using that information to select and instantiate the corresponding **Concrete Factory** (e.g., `std::make_unique<VelodyneFactory>()`). This logic, typically an `if/else` chain or a map, makes the composition root the application's central point of knowledge about all concrete types.

2. **Dependency Injection into the Client**: Once the concrete factory object is created, the setup phase concludes by injecting this dependency into the client code. This happens when `main()` calls the client function, `runPerception(factory)`. Crucially, the factory is passed as a reference to its abstract base interface, **`SensorFactory`**. This act of **Dependency Injection** marks the transition from building the graph to running the application logic. From this moment on, the client is completely decoupled, operating only on the abstract interface, remaining ignorant of the concrete object it is using.

3. **Dependency Injection**: The final step of the setup phase is **Dependency Injection**, where the `composition root` (`main()`) hands off the fully-constructed object graph to the application's client logic.
    This occurs when `main()` calls `runPerception(factory)`. The crucial detail is that the concrete factory object is passed as a reference to its abstract base interface, `SensorFactory`. This act of "upcasting" to the interface is the key mechanism that decouples the two parts of the program. It marks the clean transition from building the graph to running the application logic.

    The most powerful consequence of this is that the decoupling isn't superficial—it **propagates down the entire call stack**. The `runPerception` function acts like a general contractor who only knows the job's contract (the abstract interface), not the specific subcontractor (`VelodyneFactory`) hired to do the work. Any specialist function that `runPerception` calls, like `processFrame(sensor)`, will also work from that same abstract contract, remaining completely ignorant of the initial decision made in `main`.

    While our example injects this dependency through a simple function parameter, large-scale systems formalize this process. They often use a **Dependency Injection (DI) container**—a dedicated tool responsible for building the entire object graph. In such a system, `main()` would simply configure the container, which then automatically injects the required objects into high-level modules, typically through **constructor injection**. The core principle remains the same, but the process is automated and managed by a framework.

4.  **Client's Request**: The `runPerception` function remains blissfully unaware of concrete classes because its design adheres to several core software principles.   
    - Its **function signature** tells the whole story: it only accepts abstract interfaces like `SensorFactory`, meaning concrete types like `VelodyneLiDAR` can never appear, thus hiding implementation details. This directly supports the **Open/Closed Principle**; you can add a new `ThermalCameraSensor` and `ThermalCameraFactory` (extension) without ever modifying the existing client code (closed).   
    - Furthermore, it follows the **Dependency-Inversion Principle**, as the high-level perception logic depends on stable abstractions (`ISensor`, `SensorFactory`) rather than volatile, low-level details.   
    - This architecture also brings significant practical benefits: **unit-testing becomes trivial** by simply injecting a `MockSensorFactory`.  
    - It provides **runtime flexibility** to choose sensors from a config file. You can use command-line flags like `--mode=offline` or `--sensor=simulation` to tell the program to instantiate a `SimulatedLiDARFactory` at runtime. This allows developers to easily run the software stack with logged data for efficient offline testing without needing any physical hardware.
    - It enforces the **Single Responsibility Principle** by making `runPerception` responsible only for *using* a sensor, while the task of *building* one is left to the composition root.

5.  **Abstract Creation Call**: When the client calls the virtual `createSensor()` method, C++'s **polymorphism** mechanism ensures the correct overridden method in the concrete factory (e.g., `VelodyneFactory::createSensor`) is executed at runtime. This method returns a `std::unique_ptr<ISensor>`, which is already **upcast** to the abstract interface, so the client never sees the concrete type. Ownership is handled cleanly by the `unique_ptr` using **RAII semantics**, which guarantees identical lifetime management regardless of which factory is used. The performance overhead for this is minimal, while the gain is significant: a rigid compile-time dependency is replaced by a flexible runtime decision.

6.  **Polymorphic Dispatch**: When `factory.createSensor()` is called on the abstract factory reference, C++ performs **polymorphic dispatch**. This runtime mechanism ensures that the call is routed to the correct overridden method in the concrete factory that was injected, such as `VelodyneFactory::createSensor()`.

7.  **Concrete Instantiation**: Inside the `VelodyneFactory`'s `createSensor()` method, the actual low-level object is constructed, for example, using `std::make_unique<VelodyneLiDAR>()`. This is the single, isolated location in the entire architecture where the concrete `VelodyneLiDAR` class is ever instantiated. The details of its creation remain completely encapsulated within the factory, and ownership is safely handed off to the caller via `std::unique_ptr`.

8.  **Upcasting and Return**: The freshly created `VelodyneLiDAR` is wrapped in a `std::unique_ptr<ISensor>`, automatically up-casting it to the base interface. Ownership is now managed by RAII, and the caller sees _only_ `ISensor`—the concrete class stays hidden.


9.  **Abstract Interaction**: The client now holds a `std::unique_ptr<ISensor>` and talks to the sensor only through the `ISensor` interface — no concrete class names, no manual `delete` (RAII handles lifetime), and zero compile-time coupling to Velodyne/Ouster/Camera details.

### Practical Implications — Benefits and Engineering Trade-offs

#### When to Reach for Factory Method — Quick Heuristics

There are three quick rules of thumb, or heuristics, to help you decide when it's worth using the Factory Method design pattern. It's most valuable when your software needs to be flexible and adaptable to change.

1. **When you expect new component types frequently**   
    Ask yourself, _Will I need to add new variations of this object all the time?_

    In systems like autonomous vehicles, new sensors are added constantly. Without a factory, adding a new `OusterLIDAR` would mean searching your entire codebase for every `new VelodyneLIDAR()` and adding more `if/else` logic. This is slow, risky, and doesn't scale.

    The factory pattern solves this by centralizing object creation. To add a new sensor, you simply create a new factory for it and update the creation logic in one single place. Your high-level application code doesn't have to change at all. Think of it as a universal power adapter: you can plug in any new device without having to rewire the wall outlet.

2. **When you need different versions for different environments**   
    Ask yourself, _Will my code need to behave differently when running on real hardware versus in a simulation or a unit test?_

    Your core logic should remain the same in all these situations, but the objects it uses must be different. For example, a unit test needs a "mock" sensor that returns predictable data, while the real hardware needs a driver that communicates with the physical device.

    A factory provides a clean "seam" where you can swap these implementations. At startup, your application can decide which factory to use based on a configuration flag. This avoids littering your code with messy `#ifdef` statements and is essential for building testable software. It's like a movie director swapping in a stunt double for a dangerous scene—the story (your logic) stays the same, but the implementation is different.

3. **When you want to support third-party plugins**   
    Ask yourself, _Do I want to allow others to add functionality to my application without me having to recompile it?_

    This is the foundation of any plugin architecture. The **Factory Method** allows you to define an abstract factory interface, which acts as a "plugin contract."

    A third party can then create their own component and a corresponding factory inside a separate shared library (`.so`). Your main application can load this library at runtime, ask it for its factory, and then use that factory to create the new component, even though your app had no knowledge of it when it was compiled. This is exactly how applications like web browsers support extensions or video games support mods.

### Lateral Gains that are mostly overlooked    

1. **Hot-Swappable Simulation for Development and Continuous Integration**  

    A primary challenge in developing systems with hardware is the hardware itself. Developers may not have physical access to the required sensors on their local machines, and automated build servers in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline certainly do not. This can severely slow down development and testing cycles.

    The Factory Method pattern provides a solution by creating a clean abstraction over the instantiation process. By implementing a `SimulatedLidarFactory`, a developer can create a version of the `ISensor` product that does not require any hardware drivers. Instead, this simulated sensor can be configured to read data from a pre-recorded log file or a network stream.

    The key benefit is that switching between the live hardware and the simulation becomes a simple configuration change, not a code change. A developer can reproduce a bug found in the field by running the application with a command-line flag, like `--sensor=simulation --input=bug_report.log`. This tells the composition root to instantiate the `SimulatedLidarFactory` instead of the real one. This mechanism allows a CI server to run a full suite of integration tests using logged data, verifying the behavior of the high-level logic without needing any physical hardware. This capability is critical for maintaining developer velocity and enabling robust, automated testing.

2. **Centralized Profiling and Logging**    
    In any large-scale application, understanding performance characteristics, especially during startup, is crucial. If object instantiation (`new` calls) is scattered throughout the codebase, it becomes difficult to instrument and profile the initialization process. A developer might resort to adding timing and logging code in dozens of different files, which is an unmaintainable and error-prone practice.

    The factory method provides a natural **choke point** for the creation of an entire category of objects. Because all sensor creation is funneled through the `createSensor()` method of a factory, this becomes the ideal, centralized location for adding instrumentation.

    * **For example:** You can easily add timing logic within a concrete factory’s implementation to measure exactly how long it takes for a specific sensor driver to initialize. This allows for precise, fine-grained profiling of startup bottlenecks without cluttering the rest of the application code. Similarly, logging the sequence of factory calls can provide a clear trace of object creation for debugging complex initialization procedures.   
    

3. **Fault-Injection and Chaos Testing for Resilience**   
    Building a system that is resilient to hardware failure is a critical requirement, particularly in domains like autonomous driving. However, testing this resilience is challenging; it is often impractical or unsafe to induce real hardware failures to see how the software stack reacts. The system needs to be tested against faults in a controlled, reproducible environment.

    The factory pattern provides the perfect seam to inject faulty behavior, often by using the **Decorator pattern** in tandem. A developer can create a `FaultySensorFactory`, which is a concrete creator that wraps a real factory. This decorator factory's `createSensor()` method can contain logic to, under certain conditions, return a `FaultySensor` mock object instead of delegating the call to the real factory. This mock object can be designed to simulate specific failure modes, such as returning null data, throwing exceptions, or introducing latency.

    In the composition root, the real factory can be wrapped in this decorator when the application is launched in a special testing mode. This allows the system to be subjected to intermittent, random failures, enabling developers to test the robustness of their error-handling and recovery logic. This practice, known as **Fault Injection** or **Chaos Engineering**, is invaluable for building highly reliable, fault-tolerant systems without modifying a single line of production logic.

### Additional Trade-offs to Be Aware Of

* **Slight runtime overhead**
  One extra virtual call (factory → sensor) is negligible on x86/ARM, but on small MCUs you might prefer compile-time polymorphism (`template` factories).

* **Debugging indirection**
  Stepping through a factory chain in a debugger adds v-table jumps. Comment headers with **“Created via FactoryMethod”** tags or enable *visualize call hierarchy* tools to ease navigation.

* **Binary bloat**
  Every concrete sensor pulled into the link may bring heavy driver code. Use *registration maps* or *linker sections* so that unused factories can be stripped, or build each sensor into a separate shared object.

### Conclusion and Final Takeaways

The **Factory Method** is not just a theoretical pattern; it is a practical tool for building flexible, testable, and maintainable C++ systems. By separating the creation of an object from its usage, it enforces clean abstractions, allows for hot-swappable components, and creates a seamless structure for testing, profiling, and resilience strategies.

While it introduces minor runtime indirection and requires more upfront design, the long-term benefits are substantial for complex systems such as autonomous vehicles, real-time trading engines, or distributed cloud platforms. The indirection and minimal runtime costs are far outweighed by the clarity, flexibility, and long-term maintainability the pattern provides in large-scale applications.

Use the Factory Method when you expect to frequently add new variants of a component, especially in scenarios involving hardware swaps, simulation versus real hardware, or plugin architectures. In such environments where new component types keep appearing, simulations coexist with real hardware, or plugins and extensions are expected, the Factory Method is not merely useful—it is an essential design choice.
