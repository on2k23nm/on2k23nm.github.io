I'm **Onkar Mahajan**, a Bangalore-based software engineer nearing two decades of C/C++ and Linux/UNIX know-how under my belt. My roots are deep in the intricacies of UNIX/Linux systems and kernel internals, where work is often measured in microseconds and cache lines. From hacking GWBASIC on floppy-disk PCs to squeezing nanoseconds out of kernel-bypass I/O today, my goal has always been to master every layer from silicon to software, building systems that run fast, deterministically, and reliably.

Now, my career is evolving. I'm actively channeling this foundational low-level engineering expertise into the exciting domains of **Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Robotics**. My passion is to apply a rigorous, first-principles approach to the mathematical and algorithmic challenges of these cutting-edge fields.

This blog is simply my public lab notebook, sharing my notes and findings with all. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/onkarmahajan/) if you'd like to trade insights on performance, systems, or the future of AI. ❤️
