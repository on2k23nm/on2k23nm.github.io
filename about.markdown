## ðŸ§  Who Am I ?

Hi â€” Iâ€™m Onkar (Mahajan), 44 y.o , a systems thinker based in Bangalore, India. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how machines compute, perceive, and learn â€” not just in theory, but in the real, gritty world of systems and silicon. I donâ€™t just enjoy learning how things work; Iâ€™m driven to **build things that matter**. To me, theory isnâ€™t the end â€” itâ€™s the fuel that powers practical, intelligent creation.

My journey with computers began in my boarding school hostel from class 6, where I had early access to a modest computer lab filled with PCs that ran on floppy disks and had just 512 KB of RAM. We used to **spend hours playing games like Digger and Paratrooper and Karateka**, but the real thrill came from experimenting â€” writing programs (in early languages like **GWBASIC, Fortran & LOGO**), breaking them, rebuilding them, and understanding how every piece worked. It was pure discovery. 
_I hated every minute of my stay in the school hostel for 6 years except from my time spent the Computer Labs which were open mostly 24x7._

With long experience contributing to systems and application software products, my journey has been rich â€” but far from complete. **_The drive to build something truly meaningful, to create from first principles, and to pursue bold ideas with curiosity and craft, continues to push me forward._** I'm still fueled by the desire to learn, experiment, and bring intelligent systems to life â€” one thoughtful build at a time.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in:

* Computer systems â€” _the foundation for robust, real-time performance_
* Machine vision and deep learning â€” _enabling perception-driven intelligence_
* Edge computing â€” _bringing smart capabilities closer to the physical world_

This blog reflects my journey toward building intelligent, vision-enabled systems on the edge â€” _machines that can see, decide, and act_ in real-time, often under tight resource constraints. I write to explore ideas from first principles, document implementation insights, and share lessons learned along the way.

## ðŸ¤– Whatâ€™s Next ?

While professional work often demands structure and delivery, this space is where I return to curiosity. I'm especially drawn to the intersection of **real-time systems and machine intelligence** â€” building machines that donâ€™t just compute, but also _see_, _learn_, and _act_.

If you're driven to build intelligent machine vision systems, and seek the skills, tools, and techniques that make it possible â€” this space is for you.
