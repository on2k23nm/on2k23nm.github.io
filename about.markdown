I’m Onkar Mahajan, a Bangalore, India-based software engineer with nearly two decades of C/C++ and Linux/UNIX experience. My roots are deep in the intricacies of UNIX/Linux systems and kernel internals, where work is often measured in microseconds and cache lines. From hacking GWBASIC on floppy-disk PCs to squeezing nanoseconds out of kernel-bypass I/O today, my goal has always been to master every layer from silicon to software, building systems that are fast, deterministic, and reliable.

Leveraging this foundational expertise, my professional focus is on developing great products that matter and have a positive impact on society. Of late, I’ve become keenly interested in autonomous driving—an exceptionally hard problem whose successful solutions promise enormous societal benefits—because I thrive on tackling complex challenges that move the world forward. I am driven to apply a rigorous, first-principles approach to engineering challenges to build technology that is both powerful and purposeful.

This blog is simply my public lab notebook, sharing my notes and findings with all. Connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/onkarmahajan/)** if you’d like to trade insights on performance, systems, or building impactful technology.
