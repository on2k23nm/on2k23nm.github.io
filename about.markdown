I’m Onkar Mahajan, a Bangalore, India–based software engineer with nearly two decades of C/C++ and Linux/UNIX experience. My journey began in 1992 on an IBM PC running MS-DOS, hacking GWBASIC and playing games like Digger and Karateka. Back then, my friends and I developed a Railway Reservation System that earned us an invitation to the NCERT campus in New Delhi. From those early days of exploration to the complex systems I build today, my goal has remained the same: to master the craft of building systems that are fast, deterministic, and reliable.

My core is modern C/C++ systems engineering on Linux: designing for performance, determinism, reliability, and debuggability under real constraints. I am a builder at heart—passionate about architecting and shipping software that solves real-world problems. I thrive on seeing the tangible impact of my work, ensuring that the systems I build are not just theoretically sound but run efficiently and reliably in production.

This blog is simply my public lab notebook, sharing my notes and findings with all. Connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/onkarnm/)** if you'd like to trade insights on performance, systems, or building impactful technology.
