## 🧠 Who Am I ?

Hi — I’m Onkar (Mahajan), I live in Bangalore city in southern India. I'm a systems thinker with a deep-rooted curiosity for how machines compute, perceive, and learn. _I like to build things, not just learn theoretically - however, deep theoretical understanding is necessary to build meaningful things._

My journey with computers began in my boarding school hostel from class 6, where I had early access to a modest computer lab filled with PCs that ran on floppy disks and had just 512 KB of RAM. We used to spend hours playing games like Digger and Paratrooper and Karateka, but the real thrill came from experimenting — writing programs (in early languages like GWBASIC, Fortran, LOGO), breaking them, rebuilding them, and understanding how every piece worked. It was pure discovery. 
_I hated every minute of my stay in the school hostel for 6 years except from my time spent the Computer Labs which were open literally 24x7._

Around the same time, I was also building small robots (with DC motors and couple of batteries) — without even knowing they were called robots. That blend of play, curiosity, and engineering instinct laid the foundation for everything that followed. Even today, my dream work is to build robots (hardware robots).

Over the years, I’ve developed a strong interest in:

* **Computer systems and low-level architecture**
* **Mathematical thinking applied to intelligent systems**
* **Machine vision and deep learning**

This blog is a reflection of my ongoing exploration — capturing lessons from first principles, implementation insights, and moments of clarity across systems, algorithms, and perception.

## 🤖 What’s Next ?

While professional work often demands structure and delivery, this space is where I return to curiosity. I'm especially drawn to the intersection of **real-time systems and machine intelligence** — building machines that don’t just compute, but also _see_, _learn_, and _act_.

If you’re passionate about **Computer Systems** & **Computer vision**, or understanding technology deeply rather than just using it — I hope this blog resonates with you.
