I’m Onkar Mahajan, a Bangalore, India–based software engineer with nearly two decades of C/C++ and Linux/UNIX experience. My roots are deep in UNIX/Linux systems and kernel internals, where work is often measured in microseconds and cache lines. From hacking GWBASIC on floppy-disk PCs to squeezing nanoseconds out of kernel-bypass I/O today, my goal has always been to master every layer from silicon to software—building systems that are fast, deterministic, and reliable.

My core is modern C/C++ systems engineering on Linux: designing for performance, determinism, reliability, and debuggability under real constraints. I am a builder at heart—passionate about architecting and shipping software that solves real-world problems. I thrive on seeing the tangible impact of my work, ensuring that the systems I build are not just theoretically sound but run efficiently and reliably in production.

This blog is simply my public lab notebook, sharing my notes and findings with all. Connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/onkarnm/)** if you'd like to trade insights on performance, systems, or building impactful technology.
