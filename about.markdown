I’m Onkar Mahajan, a Bangalore, India–based software engineer with nearly two decades of C/C++ and Linux/UNIX experience. My roots are deep in UNIX/Linux systems and kernel internals, where work is often measured in microseconds and cache lines. From hacking GWBASIC on floppy-disk PCs to squeezing nanoseconds out of kernel-bypass I/O today, my goal has always been to master every layer from silicon to software—building systems that are fast, deterministic, and reliable.

My core is modern C/C++ systems engineering on Linux: designing for performance, determinism, reliability, and debuggability under real constraints. Lately, I’ve been extending that same discipline into security-oriented engineering and AI—threat modeling, safer interfaces, least privilege, and designing software that fails predictably. I don’t claim deep security-domain experience yet, but I’m actively learning, shipping small concrete projects, and writing up what I find here.

This blog is simply my public lab notebook, sharing my notes and findings with all. Connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/onkarnm/)** if you'd like to trade insights on performance, systems, or building impactful technology.
