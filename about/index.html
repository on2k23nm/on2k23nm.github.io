                    <p>I’m Onkar Mahajan, a Bangalore, India–based software engineer with nearly two decades of C/C++ and Linux/UNIX experience. My journey began in 1992 on an IBM PC running MS-DOS, hacking GWBASIC and playing games like Digger and Karateka. Back then, my friends and I developed a Railway Reservation System that earned us an invitation to the NCERT campus in New Delhi. From those early days of exploration to the complex systems I build today, my goal has remained the same: to master the craft of building systems that are fast, deterministic, and reliable.</p>

<p>My core is modern C/C++ systems engineering on Linux: designing for performance, determinism, reliability, and debuggability under real constraints. I am a builder at heart—passionate about architecting and shipping software that solves real-world problems. I thrive on seeing the tangible impact of my work, ensuring that the systems I build are not just theoretically sound but run efficiently and reliably in production.</p>

<p>This blog is simply my public lab notebook, sharing my notes and findings with all. Connect with me on <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/onkarnm/">LinkedIn</a></strong> if you’d like to trade insights on performance, systems, or building impactful technology.</p>
